# NDP Responder Configuration File
# 
# This file configures the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol Responder
# See README.md for detailed documentation

# Network interface to monitor and respond on
# This is the uplink interface where NDP solicitations will be received
link bri1

# IPv6 subnets to respond for
# Format: net <IPv6_address>/<prefix_length>
# The responder will answer neighbor solicitations for IPs within these subnets
net 2001:db8:1:2::100/120
net 2001:db8:3:4::abc/128
net 2001:db8:5:6::def/128
net fd00:1234:5678:9abc::42/128
net fd12:3456:789a:bcde::f0/128

# Excluded subnets (will NOT respond for these IPs)
# Format: nix <IPv6_address>/<prefix_length>
# Excluded subnets take precedence over included subnets
# This is useful for excluding specific ranges within larger subnets
nix 2001:db8:5:7::def/112

# Docker networks to monitor (optional)
# Format: docker <network_name>
# The responder will automatically handle IPs from Docker containers
# on the specified networks
# docker my_docker_network
# docker bridge_network

# PCap timeout in milliseconds (response batching)
# Controls how long pcap waits for packets before returning
# Lower values = faster response but slightly higher CPU usage
# Higher values = lower CPU usage but slightly slower response
# Valid range: 1-65535, Default: 5
# timeout 5

# Deduplication window in milliseconds
# Controls how long to remember recently seen solicitations
# Solicitations within this window are considered duplicates and skipped
# Useful for filtering RFC retransmission bursts
# Lower values = more responsive but might miss legitimate retransmissions
# Higher values = filters more duplicates but might delay responses
# Valid range: 1-65535, Default: 100
# dedup 100

# Enable proactive announcements at startup
# When enabled, the responder will send gratuitous neighbor advertisements
# for all configured IP addresses when it starts
proactive

# Enable verbose logging
# When enabled, detailed information about processed packets and responses
# will be logged to stdout/syslog
# verbose
